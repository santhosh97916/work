<p class="big-text">Fashion is a term used interchangeably to describe the creation of clothing, footwear, accessories, cosmetics, and jewellery of different cultural aesthetics and their mix and match into outfits that depict distinctive ways of dressing (styles and trends) as signifiers of social status, self-expression, and group belonging. As a multifaceted term, fashion describes an industry, styles, aesthetics, and trends.</p>
<p><h2> media plays a significant role when it comes to fashion. For instance, an important part of fashion is fashion journalism.</h2></p>

        <h2><P>Fashion public relations involves being in touch with a company's audiences and creating strong relationships with them, reaching out to media, and initiating messages that project positive images of the company.[103] Social media plays an important role in modern-day fashion public relations; enabling practitioners to reach a wide range of consumers through various platforms.</p>
        <br>
    <br>
<h2><p>Building brand awareness and credibility is a key implication of good public relations. In some cases, the hype is built about new designers' collections before they are released into the market, due to the immense exposure generated by practitioners.[105] Social media, such as blogs, microblogs, podcasts, photo and video sharing sites have all become increasingly important to fashion public relations.[106] The interactive nature of these platforms allows practitioners to engage and communicate with the public in real-time, and tailor their clients' brand or campaign messages to the target audience. With blogging platforms such as Instagram, Tumblr, WordPress, Squarespace, and other sharing sites, bloggers have emerged as expert fashion commentators, shaping brands and having a great impact on what is 'on trend'.[107] Women in the fashion public relations industry such as Sweaty Betty PR founder Roxy Jacenko and Oscar de la Renta's PR girl Erika Bearman, have acquired copious followers on their social media sites, by providing a brand identity and a behind the scenes look into the companies they work for.   
</p></h2>
<br>
<br><h2><p>Social media is changing the way practitioners deliver messages,[30] as they are concerned with the media, and also customer relationship building.[108] PR practitioners must provide effective communication among all platforms, in order to engage the fashion public in an industry socially connected via online shopping.[109] Consumers have the ability to share their purchases on their personal social media pages (such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.), and if practitioners deliver the brand message effectively and meet the needs of its public, word-of-mouth publicity will be generated and potentially provide a wide reach for the designer and their products.</p></h2>

            <br><br>
        <h2><p>Fashion is not an individual choice but is a group choice. So long as a particular choice remains confined lo an individual, it may better be called ‘style’ and not fashion. The style becomes a fashion when adopted by a number of people.</p></h2>
    <br><br><h2><P>
        The important characteristic of fashion is its changing nature. If it survives long, it ceases to be a fashion and may become a folkway or mores.
    </P></h2>
    <br><br><h2><p>
        
        
        Custom stands for sociality, fashion for individuality. Custom is followed by all the members of a community and this universal following creates social bonds between them. Fashion is started by somebody and somebody has to be the last to adopt it.
<br><br><h2><p>Just how fashion starts is still something of a mystery requiring more sociological research to solve than has yet been given it. When it becomes universal, it loses its novelty and gives place to a new fashion. By following a custom an individual seeks to identify himself with the rest, whereas by following a fashion he seeks to distinguish himself from the rest.</p></h2>

                        <h2><p><h2><p>The origin of Fashion is from the year 1826. Probably everyone believes Charles Frederick to be the first fashion designer of the world. He also established the first Fashion house in Paris. Consequently, he began the tradition of Fashion houses. Furthermore, he gave advice to customers on what clothing would suit them. He was prominent form 1826 to 1895.</p></h2>
<br><br><h2><p> During this period, many design houses hired artists. Furthermore, the job of these artists was to develop innovative designs for garments. The clients would examine many different patterns. Then they would pick the one they like. Consequently, a tradition began of presenting patterns to customers and then stitching them.</p></h2>
                           
                          <br><br><h2><P>  
                            At the beginning of the 20th century, new developments in Fashion took place. These developments certainly began in Paris first. Then they spread in other parts of the world. Consequently, new designs first came into existence in France. From Paris, they went to other parts of the world. Hence, Paris became the Fashion capital of the world. Also, Fashion in this era was ‘haute couture’. This Fashion design was exclusively for individuals</P></h2><br><h2><p>    In the mid-20th century, a change took place. Now Fashion garments underwent mass production. There was a significant increase in the rate of production of Fashion garments. As a result, more and more people became involved with Fashion garments. By the end of the 20th century, a sense of Fashion awareness was very strong. Now people began to choose clothes based on their own style preference. Hence, people began to create their own trends instead of relying on existing trends.</p></h2>

                                <h2><p>   "Fashion technology" is the term used for incorporating technological advancements into the manufacturing and selling of fashion products. This concept has a wide range of applications in the fashion industry, including the sourcing, production, design, and retail processes. 

                                    Digital technology is also utilized in fashion technology to minimize waste and support sustainable practices. In addition to physical fashion items, prominent global brands are using Web3 and metaverse platforms to offer virtual fashion products.
                                    
                                    The rise of fashion technology has given birth to "fashion tech experts," who speculate that this trend may eventually form a distinct industry within the fashion sector. However, it is unclear whether this outcome is feasible.
